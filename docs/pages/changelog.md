## refactor(run-log): extract _writeClaudeCall helper
**2026-05-08 19:02 PDT · refactor · 267.4s · $1.6061**

**Goal:** Deduplicate three near-identical Claude-call writers in `RunLog` (`agentStep`, `summaryStep`, `fixerInvocation`) by extracting a private helper.

**Outcome:** Added `_writeClaudeCall(prefix, kind, systemPrompt, userPrompt, response, exitCode, durationMs, extra)` that writes the `*.system.md` / `*.user.md` / `*.response.txt` artifacts, increments `claudeCallCount`, and emits the corresponding event with `systemBytes` / `userBytes` / `responseBytes`. Each public method now computes only its own prefix and per-kind `extra` fields (`stepIndex`, `iteration`) and delegates to the helper, while preserving its own counter bumps (`agentStepCount`, `fixerInvocationCount`). Behavior, file names, and event payload shapes are unchanged.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/munchkins-core/src/run-log.ts` — introduced `_writeClaudeCall` helper; rewrote `agentStep`, `summaryStep`, and `fixerInvocation` to delegate to it; consolidated the `claudeCallCount` increment into the helper.
